This HTML and CSS code outlines a responsive, user-friendly interface for an e-learning platform, intended to provide learners with a clean and organized way to access courses, track progress, and view video content. The webpage is structured with semantic HTML5 elements and styled using internal CSS. It begins with the <head> section, setting up the meta tags for character encoding and viewport scaling, and includes a custom title. The <style> block defines aesthetic and layout rules, applying a modern Segoe UI font across the body, side margins for spacing, a light background, and zero padding for a cleaner canvas. The header uses a vibrant orange (#ff6600) background with centered text in white to announce the platform and offer a welcoming message. Directly below, a navigation bar with a dark background allows users to quickly access sections labeled "Courses," "Progress," and "Videos"; each link is styled in bold white text with hover effects to enhance interactivity. The main content is wrapped in a div with the ID courses (note the typo cointainer, which should be corrected to container), and contains a subsection titled "Course Listing." Three individual course modules are displayed using a card-like layout with white backgrounds, rounded corners, box shadows, and internal padding for visual appeal. Each course block features a title, a brief description, a progress bar component, and an embedded YouTube video using an <iframe>. The progress bars are constructed with nested div elements: the outer .progress-bar div provides a light gray background with rounded corners, while the inner .progress div visually fills a portion of the bar using a green background (#28a745), with widths set inline (e.g., 80% for HTML & CSS Basics). These values could reflect learning progress metrics or completion percentages. The use of iframes allows video playback directly within the course sections, giving users direct access to tutorial content without leaving the page. Videos are responsively styled to fill the container’s width and a fixed height of 250px. The footer element appears at the bottom of the page, adopting the same dark theme as the nav bar, and includes a centered copyright message specific to a 2025 CODTECH Internship UI task. Overall, the structure is visually balanced and simple to navigate, benefiting from strong design principles such as consistent spacing, clear visual hierarchy, interactive feedback through hover states, and progressive enhancement through embedded media. The code also uses flexbox within the nav bar to align links properly and promotes reusability and extendability. There are minor improvements that could be addressed, such as fixing the container class typo and possibly enhancing accessibility by using ARIA roles or landmarks, but the current build serves as a solid foundation for an educational front-end project. This UI demonstrates core front-end development concepts including layout design, multimedia embedding, responsive styling, progress visualization, and semantic markup—making it suitable for use in a GitHub portfolio as a demonstration of skills in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript integration (indirectly through video content).
